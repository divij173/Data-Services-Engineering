# Data-Services-Engineering

## Overview

This course introduces core concepts and practical skills for engineering data in Web-service-oriented data-driven applications. Students will learn fundamental infrastructure for building data services on the Web, including techniques for accessing and ingesting data from internal/external sources, developing software services for data curation (e.g., extraction, transformation, correction, aggregation), applying various analytics, and visualizing data for effective communication. Python is used as the primary programming language for practical modules, although the concepts are applicable to any web development language/framework.

This course aims to introduce the student to core concepts and practical skills for engineering the data in Web-service-oriented data-driven applications. Specifically, the course aims to expose students to basic infrastructure for building data services on the Web, including techniques to access and ingest data in internal/external sources, develop software services to curate (e.g. extract, transform, correct, aggregate the data), develop services to apply various analytics and develop services to visualize the data to communicate effectively using data. The course uses the Python programming language as the practical basis for its modules. However, the concepts taught are universal and can be applied to any other web development language/framework.

## Project 1: International Airlines Data Analysis

### Dataset Description
- **City Pairs Data (city_pairs.csv):** Contains information about international flights to and from Australia in monthly intervals from January 1985 until September 2022. Includes passenger, freight, and mail data.
    - Dataset Source: [International Airlines Traffic by City Pairs](https://data.gov.au/data/dataset/international-airlines-traffic-by-city-pairs/resource/ebcafd83-9514-4f72-a995-fe7ee90cb9da)
- **Operated Flights and Seats Data (seats.csv):** Provides information about international airlines to and from Australia in monthly intervals from September 2003 until September 2022. Covers airline activity, airport locations, and maximum seat capacity.
    - Dataset Source: [International Airlines Operated Flights and Seats](https://data.datahub.freightaustralia.gov.au/dataset/international-airlines-operated-flights-andseats)
